# Odin-Project
The Odin Project's structure dictates seperate repos for each project within the tutorial. 
Since I'm just using the Odin Project to brush up on frontend development, I'm just keeping all of my work on it in here.

Any major work that I do through the OP that I feel warrants its own repo (both for organizational and portfolio work) will get its own, however.
